# shortest path and random path

## Shortest path
a* implementation with and nodes.

To test:
- Go to shortest_path
- run: python main.py

The small_graph.json/small_graph_2.json are some test files and a copy (with 'parent' links for and nodes) should be written to the atkgraph.json file.

## Random path 

To test:
- run: python main.py
